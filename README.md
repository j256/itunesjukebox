iTunes Juke Box is a Java application designed to run a party from your
Mac by driving the iTunes via Applescript.  The application starts up a
web-server (by default on port 8080), allows you to choose the party
playlist from iTune, and allows people to view the tracks available
and vote on their favorites.  The play list then gets updated dynamically
according to people's preferences.
