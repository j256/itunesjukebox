iTunes Juke Box is a Java application designed to run a party from your
Macintosh computer by driving the iTunes running on the local computer via
Applescript.  The application starts up a web-server, allows you to choose the
party playlist from iTune, and allows people to view the tracks available
and vote on their favorite.  The play list then gets updated dynamically
according to people's preferences.
